## 🌟 Why Vite Over CRA (Create React App)?

✅ Faster Development:
Vite starts instantly and performs hot-reloading faster than CRA.

✅ Leverages Modern Tools:
Vite uses ES modules and Rollup, while CRA relies on webpack, making Vite more lightweight and efficient.

✅ Simpler and Leaner:
Vite has a smaller configuration, less bloat, and a simpler directory structure, which lets you focus on coding instead of wrestling with configuration files.

✅ Better Experience:
With faster builds and instant refresh, developing with Vite feels more productive and enjoyable.
